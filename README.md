this is the same as ubuntu Terminal. You can compile by using Makefile file and run all your command. Also you can use other easy command instead of the unix commands like below
# listdir instead of ls
# footprint instead of history
# currentpath instead of pwd
# printfile instead of cat
and you can exit by using exit command or CTRL + C
